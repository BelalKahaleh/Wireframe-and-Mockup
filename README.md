Project Overview
This project is dedicated to the design and development of the The Corner Coffee coffee shop's websiteinterface. The goal is to create a visually appealing, user-friendly, and functional experience for customers looking to explore the coffee shop's offerings, location, and services. The project uses Figma as the primary design tool to build wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity UI designs. Pinterest is used as a source of inspiration to gather visual assets, color palettes, and design trends to help create a warm, inviting, and modern digital experience.

Tools Used
Figma: A powerful, cloud-based design tool for creating interactive wireframes, high-fidelity UI designs, and prototypes. Figma allows for seamless collaboration and quick iteration.
Pinterest: A platform used to collect design inspiration, images, and visual styles that align with the brand identity of The Corner Coffee. Pinterest helps to discover color schemes, typography, layout ideas, and other visual elements.

Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

/Designs: Contains all Figma design files, including wireframes, prototypes, and final UI designs.
/Wireframes: Low-fidelity wireframes outlining the basic structure and layout of the coffee shop's website and mobile app.
/High_Fidelity: Final, polished UI designs that represent the final look and feel of the project, including color, typography, and imagery.
/Prototypes: Interactive prototypes demonstrating user flows and key interactions (e.g., ordering coffee, viewing the menu, checking store locations).
/Inspiration: A collection of design inspiration gathered from Pinterest, including mood boards, UI patterns, typography styles, and color palettes.
/Mood_Boards: Curated visual inspiration that sets the tone and ambiance for the coffee shop's digital presence.
/UI_Patterns: Design elements like buttons, forms, and icons, sourced from Pinterest, to help create a cohesive user experience.
